# Weather Analysis in Python with Jupyter Notebook

## A comparison of weather data between Edinburgh and New York City

The purpose of this project is to compare the yearly weather patterns in Edinburgh with New York City, making use of a temperature conversion function to also cross-compare between Fahrenheit and Celsius scales. The comparisons should therefore be intuitive to users of either temperature scale.

Additional future comparisons include:
- precipitation frequency/daily average
- humidity
- daily temperature variation 

I suspect that the average daily temperature fluctuation, i.e. the range between the daily high and daily low, is much greater in NYC, but I'm curious to see the outcome. I also suspect that the frequency of precipitation is higher in Edinburgh, with a lower average precipitation (in mm) than NYC.
